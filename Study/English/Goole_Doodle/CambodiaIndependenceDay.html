<p>Happy 69th Independence Day, 
    <b>Cambodia</b>! The <b>nation’s Declaration</b> of Independence was signed on this day in 1953
    , marking the start of its <b>sovereignty</b> after a century of foreign rule. 
    Today’s Doodle celebrates the <b>resilience</b> and <b>pride</b> of the Cambodian people and honors the late King Father Norodom Sihanouk
    , who was <b>wholeheartedly</b> devoted to achieving independence.
</p>

<p>On Independence Day
    , Cambodians celebrate with <b>extravagant festivals</b> and <b>feasts</b>. 
    Some <b>traditional</b> Cambodian <b>dishes</b> include 'amok trey' (<b>steamed fish and coconut curry</b>)
    , 'bai sak chrouk' (pork and rice) and 'beef loc lac' (<b>tender</b> beef with <b>lime dipping sauce</b>). 
    The main formal celebration <b>occurs</b> at the Independence Monument in <b>central</b> Phnom Penh, 
    where the Norodom Sihanouk <b>Memorial</b> (or the Statue of King Father Norodom Sihanouk) is also located.
</p>

<p>A <b>gala parade</b> also takes place as <b>marching bands</b> and colorful <b>floats boast</b> the red and blue national Cambodian flag, 
    like the one <b>waving</b> in today’s artwork. 
    To end the holiday, 
    a <b>massive fireworks</b> display cascades across the sky near the Royal Palace.
