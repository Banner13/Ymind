<p>Today's Doodle celebrates Turkish actor Hulusi Kentmen. 
He was one of the most beloved and prolific performers during the “Yesilcam” period of Turkish cinema.</p>

<p>Kentmen was born on January 20, 1912 in Veliko Tărnovo, Bulgaria, but grew up in Turkey near the Gulf of Izmit. 
    He took an interest in acting at Akcakoca Primary school’s theater. 
    While serving in the navy, Kentmen regularly performed in plays at community theaters, 
    where he caught the eye of Burhanettin Tepsi, a renowned theater director.</p>

<p>Kentmen started his career in the cinema industry in the 1940s but continued to take the stage in theater productions from time to time. 
    He’s best remembered by the father figures he regularly played who had tough exteriors and a good heart.
     After appearing in nearly 500 films over 40 years, Kentmen became known as the “father” of Yesilcam movies. </p>

<p>Today, in Turkey, the phrase “like Hulusi Kentmen” is widely used to describe a firm but loving person.</p>
